        <h1>Step Four</h1>
        <p> Feel your breath: Find place to sit that feels calm and quiet to you.</p>

        <h1>Step Five</h1>
        <p>Notice when your mind has wandered: Inevitably, your attention will leave the breath and wander to other places.
		 When you get around to noticing that your mind has wandered—in a few seconds, a minute, five minutes—simply return your attention to the breath..</p>

        <h1>Step Six</h1>
        <p>Notice Your body: You can sit in a chair with your feet on the floor, you can sit loosley cross-legged, you can kneel, all are fine. Just make sure you are
            stable and in position you can stay in for a while
